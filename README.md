# PacMan
Pac Man assignment MIT full stack dev course

PacMen Factory Game.

When users click the 'Add PacMan' button, a div html element containing an image of the pacman game character is inserted into the DOM at a random positionon the screen. Then users can add a unlimited number of PacMen characters before and after clicking the 'Start Game' button.

After a user starts the game, the PacMen will move across the screen at their own randomly assigned velocities, changing direction when they hit screen edges and opening/closing their mouths every half second. Users may stop the game with the 'Stop Game' button, and restart it with 'Start Game' at any point.

To start over, refresh the browser window.

Roadmap of Future Improvements
